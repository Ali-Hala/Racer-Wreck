# Racer Wreck

## Overview
This Python code is a game project developed as a final assignment. The game, named "Racer Wreck," is designed as a racing game where players control a car on a track while avoiding collisions with the track walls and competing against a computer-controlled car. The game features multiple levels and includes functionalities such as collision detection, level progression, time tracking, and user interface elements.

## Instructions
1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system.
2. Run the code in a Python environment that supports Pygame.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to navigate through the start screen, rules screen, and gameplay.
4. Use keyboard controls to maneuver your car (W for forward, A for left, D for right, S for backward).
5. Complete levels by reaching the finish line while avoiding collisions with track walls and beating the computer car to the finish line.
6. On completion, you'll be presented with an end screen showing credits and options to quit or retry.

## Key Features
- **Game Levels:** The game consists of multiple levels, with each level presenting increasing challenges.
- **Player and Computer Cars:** Players control one car while competing against a computer-controlled car.
- **Collision Detection:** Collision detection is implemented to handle collisions between the player's car and the track walls.
- **Time Tracking:** The game tracks the time taken by the player to complete each level.
- **User Interface:** Start, rules, and end screens provide a user-friendly interface for navigation and interaction.
